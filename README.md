| End                  | You mark the end of a command using ```;```.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | ```test 1;```                                                                                                  |
| Screen               | Sets a list of whole possitive number varibles from 0-9 in a table format of varying sizes, use an end to mark the end of a row                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ```[screen]```<br> ```0 0 0 0;```<br> ```0 0 0 0;```<br> ```0 0 0 0;```<br> ```0 0 0 0;```<br> ```[/screen]``` |
| Varibles             | You may set or call a varible, either assigning a value to it or using it's assigned value for other logic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ```example```                                                                                                  |
| Varible assignment   | when writeing varible logic, the varible on the left most side of the argument will be written over based off whats writen to the right                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ```example 1;```                                                                                               |
| Varible modification | You can modify the value of varibles rather then setting an exact value, using either ```+```, ```-```, ```*``` or ```/``` for addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.                                                                                                                                                                                      | ```example + 1;```                                                                                             |
| Varible call         | You may call another varible inside another document, either using it for internal logic, or writeing over it, depending on if you place the varible on the left or right. <br> You must suround the argument in ```[]```, write the name of the document your calling, followed by a ```.```, then the name of the varible.                                            | ```[Doc.Varible]```                                                                                            |
| Screen varible call  | Varible calls may also be used to call for a varible inside of a screen, using the same syntax as with a varible call, but with some slight modifications. <br> To do so, you'll need to name the table your calling, then for the varible name inside another set of ```[]```, define where on the table your calling to, with 2 sets of numbers divided by a ```,```. | ```[Table.[0,0]]```                                                                                            |
| comparison operator  | when modifying a varible, you can set a minimum or maximum value to that varible, if your varible doesnt already fall into the specified range, it is set to the specified value. <br> ``>`` and ``<`` are used for this command, ``>`` stating that the varible has to be at least larger, while ``<`` stateing the varible has to be at most smaller                  | ```Varible > 1;```                                                                                             |
| Comments             | allows you to write down text with no influance on the code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ```//comment```                                                                                                |
| Multi lined comment  | Allows you to write a comment across multiple lines                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ```<comment>``` <br> ```text``` <br> ```text2``` <br> ```text3``` <br> ```</comment>```                        |
