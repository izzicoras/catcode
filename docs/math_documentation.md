|Syntax|Explanation|Example|Example output|
|------|-----------|-------|--------------|
|Set varible| Allows you to define an exact value for a varible| ```varible 0;```| "Varible" is set to exactly 0.|
|Addition| Allows you to add a value to a varible| ```varible 0;```<br>```Varible + 1;```| "Varible" is set to 0, then has 1 added, giving a total output of 1|
|Subtraction| Allows you to subtract a value from another value| ```Varible 10;``` <br> ```Varible - 5;```| "Varible" is set to 10, then has 5 taken away, giving an output of 5.|
|Multiplicaiton| Allows you to multiply a value with another value| ```Varible 2;``` <br> ```Varible * 3;``` | "Varible" is set to 2, then multiplied by 3, giving an output of 6.|
|Division| Allows you to divide a varible by another varible| ```Varible 9;``` <br> ```varible / 3;```| "Varible" is set to 9, then divided by 3, giving an output of 3.|
|Varible modification direction| When modifying or assigning a value in a varible, it's always the first varible listed to be modified, all other varibles only define how it is modified. | ```varibleI 3;``` <br> ```varibleII 1;``` <br> ```varibleI + varibleII;``` | in this case, "varibleI" is assigned with the value of "3", "varibleII" is then assigned a value of 1, "varibleI" then has the value of "varibleII" added to it, giving "varibleI" a value of 4 while "varibleII" retains it's value of 1.|
